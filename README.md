# Code Blocks forked

[Code Blocks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-blocks/ebieibfdjgmmimpldgengceekpfefmfd) is a syntax highlighter add-on for Google Docs.

#### A quick note on requesting new languages:

Code Blocks is powered by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) and
can only provide syntax highlighting for languages that it supports. If
you would like Code Blocks to add support for a language that is
implemented by highlight.js, feel free to submit a request via the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/alexwforsythe/code-blocks/issues/new).
Otherwise, please refer to their page on requesting new languages, found
[here](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language-requests.html).
